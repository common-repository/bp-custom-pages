This is a BuddyPress plugin which allows site admins to create up to 4 "Custom Pages" which are displayed automatically in the users "Custom Pages" tab which can be easily renamed.

== Description ==

This plugin sets up a new custom post type - bp-custom-pages. Only the site admin are able to create new pages from this custom post type. Once a new page is created and published, a new custom page is created in each users "Custom Pages" tab. These pages as part of the BP profile and therefore any bp widgets or shortcodes used on the page will pull in the displayed users details. The idea being the site admin can set up a number of standard pages for each user - eg. Testimonial, with a pre-set layout under the control of site admin. 

The url for each page would be www.sitename.com/pagename/username.

If you want more pages, and perhaps private pages too check out BP Custom Pages Pro available from [BuddyPress User](https://buddyuser.com/pro-plugin-bp-custom-pages-pro)

== Installation ==

Download and upload the plugin to your plugins folder. You can activate it to test the examples it provides. You will want to edit and use the plugin to learn or as a base, it is not designed to be a plugin for functional use.
